* Welcome to the Blog

This is my first post using the Rust blog engine! It supports *org-mode* syntax with /all/ the formatting you'd expect.

** Features

- Org-mode parsing with orgize
- Syntax highlighting with syntect
- Embedded static files
- Clean, minimal design

** Code Example

Here's a simple Rust function:

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
fn fibonacci(n: u32) -> u32 {
    match n {
        0 => 0,
        1 => 1,
        _ => fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2),
    }
}

fn main() {
    println!("fib(10) = {}", fibonacci(10));
}
#+END_SRC

Pretty cool, right?
