* Why Org-Mode?

Org-mode is a powerful markup language that's perfect for technical writing. It supports:

1. Headings and structure
2. Lists (ordered and unordered)
3. Code blocks with syntax highlighting
4. Links, emphasis, and more

* Writing Posts

Simply create a new =.org= file in the =content/posts/= directory with the following frontmatter:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
#+TITLE: Your Post Title
#+DATE: 2025-01-20

Your content here...
#+END_SRC

** Syntax Highlighting

The blog engine uses syntect for beautiful syntax highlighting. Here's a Python example:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def greet(name):
    """Greet someone by name."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(greet("World"))
#+END_SRC

* Next Steps

Try adding your own posts and customizing the CSS to match your style!
