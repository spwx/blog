#+TITLE: Hello World
#+DATE: 2025-12-28

* I Wanted A Blog
I'd already been learning Rust for a while, so I spent three days
working through [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLo5Oa5DU0IYnXbSRNQrFrAW804drtEqeU][Watery Desert's Rust Axum Askama tutorial]]. It was an
excellent playlist that taught me new things about:

- [[https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum][Axum]] - web framework
- [[https://github.com/askama-rs/askama][Askama]] - Jinja-like templating engine
- [[https://docs.rs/tower][Tower]] - middleware library
- [[https://docs.rs/tower-http][Tower-HTTP]] - HTTP-specific middleware and utilities
- [[https://just.systems/][Just]] - Command runner like make
- [[https://code.visualstudio.com][VSCode]] - Free, open source code editor by Microsoft
- and probably more

* Then I Just Used AI
I already knew AI was great for learning new things. I use the [[https://claude.ai/][Claude]]
desktop app pretty often for that. But [[https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview][Claude Code]] is something
completely different - it really does things. I decided to use it to
build the blog, taking it slow, one feature at a time, and it just did
everything for me...

There were a few hiccups. Once it tried to install [[https://www.docker.com/][Docker]] in an [[https://linuxcontainers.org/lxc/introduction/][LXC]]
container, which wasn't necessary. Just asking what it was doing set
it back on track though.

I had a small home server I bought earlier this year but forgot how
I'd set it up. Claude Code helped me figure out what was going on and
get everything working again.

Security needed some watching. When setting up port forwarding on my
router, it didn't make sure I only opened those ports to [[https://www.cloudflare.com/][Cloudflare]],
my web reverse-proxy service. I had to catch that myself.

Claude Code also handled all the [[https://git-scm.com/][git]] stuff for me - commits, branches,
the whole thing. I didn't have to think about version control at all.
Which is a huge relief.

Using the [[https://github.com/exa-labs/exa-mcp-server][exa-mcp server]] was helpful for getting info on libraries and
APIs.

* Future Ideas For Working With Claude Code
Next time I work with Claude Code, I'm going to ask it to generate
more shell scripts instead of running commands directly. Sometimes
it's difficult to follow everything it's doing. Having scripts I can
review and execute myself would give me better visibility and control
over the process.

I also need to find a tool to better review the diffs in a side-by-side
way. It would be easier to see what's changing.

* Everything It Did, Or Walked Me Through
Here's a list of everything Claude Code either implemented directly or
guided me through setting up. It's honestly impressive how much ground
"we" covered:

** Initial Blog Engine Creation
- Built entire blog from scratch using Rust, Axum, and Askama
  templating
- [[https://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]] support - Parse and render .org files with frontmatter
  (TITLE, DATE) using [[https://github.com/PoiScript/orgize][orgize]]
- Embedded architecture - Single binary with all content and static
  files baked in using [[https://github.com/pyrossh/rust-embed][rust-embed]]
- Syntax highlighting - Integrated [[https://github.com/trishume/syntect][syntect]] for code blocks in org-mode
  posts
- Basic routes - Index page listing posts, individual post pages,
  static file serving

** Theme & Design System

- Ported ef-maris themes from [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] - Brought over both dark and light
  variants from [[https://protesilaos.com/emacs/ef-themes][Protesilaos Stavrou's ef-themes]]
- Theme toggle - Built functional dark/light mode switcher in header
  with SVG sun/moon icons
- Smart theme detection - Respects system preference
  (prefers-color-scheme) on first visit
- LocalStorage persistence - Remembers user's theme choice
- System theme listener - Auto-switches with OS theme if user hasn't
  manually set preference
- Smooth transitions - CSS transitions between theme switches

** Typography & Color

- Custom font stack:
  - Headings: [[https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Farro][Farro]] ([[https://fonts.google.com/][Google Fonts]])
  - Code: [[https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/][JetBrains Mono]]
  - Body: System fonts
- Rainbow org-mode headings - Implemented colored H1-H6 using ef-maris
  palette:
  - H1: green-cooler, H2: blue-warmer, H3: green-warmer
  - H4: cyan, H5: magenta-cooler, H6: blue-cooler
- Full CSS variables - Comprehensive design system with --fg-primary,
  --bg-secondary, --color-link, etc.

** Search Functionality

- Server-side search with /search?q=query endpoint
- Header search form - Integrated into header next to theme toggle
- Search results page with context excerpts showing ~200 chars around
  matches
- HTML entity decoding - Cleaned up entities in search results
  (quotes, ampersands, etc.)
- Smart excerpt generation - Shows context around search terms with
  word boundary detection

** UI/UX Polish

- Aligned header controls - Theme toggle and search button same height
- Dynamic copyright year - JavaScript-based auto-updating footer
- Code copy buttons - Added to all code blocks with visual feedback
- Responsive design - Mobile-friendly search forms and layouts
- Accessibility - ARIA labels, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation

** Deployment Infrastructure

- [[https://linuxcontainers.org/lxc/introduction/][LXC]] container setup in [[https://www.proxmox.com/][Proxmox]] with proper configuration
- [[https://caddyserver.com/][Caddy]] reverse proxy - Automatic HTTPS with [[https://letsencrypt.org/][Let's Encrypt]] for
  wall.ninja
- [[https://systemd.io/][Systemd]] service - Auto-restart on failure, proper logging
- [[https://www.cloudflare.com/][Cloudflare]] + [[https://opnsense.org/][OPNsense]] - DNS proxy, DDoS protection, port forwarding
- Created setup-blog.sh - Automated server provisioning script
- Created justfile - just deploy command for one-command deployments
- Cross-compilation setup - [[https://github.com/rust-cross/cargo-zigbuild][cargo-zigbuild]] + [[https://ziglang.org/][zig]] for Mac → Linux
  builds

** Performance & Reliability

- HTTP compression - Gzip compression via [[https://docs.rs/tower-http][tower-http]]
- Rate limiting consideration - Initially implemented, then removed in
  favor of [[https://caddyserver.com/][Caddy]]-level protection
- Zero-downtime deploys - [[https://systemd.io/][systemd]] automatically restarts service after
  binary update

** Documentation

- Comprehensive README - Tech stack, project structure, deployment
  instructions, design credits
- Cross-compilation docs - Why [[https://ziglang.org/][zig]] is used and how to set it up
- Server setup guide - Complete infrastructure documentation
