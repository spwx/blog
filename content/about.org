#+TITLE: About Me

* Hello, World!

I have lived several lives - Coast Guardsman, cyber defender, and now
Amazonian problem-solver. I spent 23 years in the [[https://www.uscg.mil/][U.S. Coast Guard]], 17
of those as an Electronics Technician, chasing down faults in Fire
Control, Radar, Communication, and Navigation systems aboard 270-foot
cutters. Nine years underway earned me the title of "salty Cutterman,"
along with an advanced degree in fixing things that absolutely
shouldn't be fixable. I even did a stint on the remote island of St.
Paul Island, Alaska, keeping [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LORAN][LORAN]] navigation alive with little more
than solder and stubbornness.

When I finally came ashore, I spent the next five years racking up 20
cyber security certifications (including [[https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP][CISSP]] and [[https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/][OSCP]]), helped stand
up Cyber Command at [[https://www.uscg.mil/][USCG]] Headquarters, and, as a Senior Analyst at
[[https://www.cisa.gov/][CISA]], created an interactive [[https://www.linux.org/][Linux]] course that's still shared across
the federal government. I proudly retired as a Chief and immediately
grew a Gandalf-level beard to mark the occasion.

I joined [[https://aws.amazon.com/][Amazon]] in 2023, where I've become known for tackling some
of the most complex cases with detailed precision and just enough
sarcasm to keep things interesting. I'm a rare D.C. native, an
unapologetic [[https://www.rust-lang.org/][Rust]] advocate, and an enthusiastic teacher.

When not deep in code or solving problems of volcanic proportions, I
spend my time with my three amazing kids and my incredibly patient,
brilliant wife — who has weathered both deployments and the beard era
with equal grace.

I'm not big on social media, by try to check my [[https://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-wall-1b5b22126][LinkedIn]] every month
or so.
